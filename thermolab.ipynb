    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the quantum chemistry package **PySCF** to connect\n",
    "electronic-structure calculations with macroscopic thermodynamic quantities.\n",
    "Starting from a molecular geometry, you will\n",
    "\n",
    "- optimize the structure,\n",
    "- compute vibrational frequencies, and\n",
    "- obtain thermodynamic functions such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free\n",
    "  energy at a chosen temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already seen in statistical thermodynamics how partition functions\n",
    "lead to expressions for $U$, $H$, $S$, and $G$. Here, you will see how\n",
    "those ideas are implemented in a modern electronic-structure code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermochemistry links molecular properties to bulk observables such as\n",
    "reaction energies and equilibrium constants. From statistical mechanics, you\n",
    "know that these quantities can be obtained from a molecular partition function\n",
    "built from translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, quantum chemistry packages approximate these contributions using\n",
    "models such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ideal-gas translation**,\n",
    "- the **rigid rotor** for rotations, and\n",
    "- the **harmonic oscillator** for vibrations,\n",
    "\n",
    "combined with an electronic energy from a chosen quantum-chemical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses PySCF's `hessian.thermo` utilities to assemble these contributions\n",
    "and report thermodynamic quantities. As you work through the examples, keep the\n",
    "following connections in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how the normal modes and frequencies from a Hessian calculation enter the\n",
    "  vibrational partition function, and\n",
    "- how the resulting thermodynamic functions relate to the familiar\n",
    "  relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\Delta_r G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K^\\circ,\n",
    "  \\quad\n",
    "  G = H - TS.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the accompanying notebooks, you will apply the same ideas to three\n",
    "thermochemistry case studies: the water–gas shift reaction, conformational\n",
    "equilibria, and an acid–base reaction.\n",

    "- Standard thermodynamic conditions are taken as $T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and\n",
    "  $P = 1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$.\n",
    "- All electronic-structure calculations use a single, consistent level of\n",
    "  theory: PBE0-D4/def2-TZVPPD, with a polarizable continuum model (PCM) for water\n",
