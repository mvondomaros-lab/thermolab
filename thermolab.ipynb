    "# Thermo Lab: Thermochemistry with PySCF\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will use the quantum chemistry package **PySCF** to connect\n",
    "electronic-structure calculations with macroscopic thermodynamic quantities.\n",
    "Starting from a molecular geometry, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- optimize the structure,\n",
    "- compute vibrational frequencies, and\n",
    "- obtain thermodynamic functions such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy\n",
    "  at a chosen temperature and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already seen in statistical thermodynamics how partition functions lead\n",
    "to expressions for $U$, $H$, $S$, and $G$. Here you will see how those ideas are\n",
    "implemented in a modern electronic-structure code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, quantum chemistry packages approximate thermochemical contributions using models such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ideal-gas translation**,\n",
    "- the **rigid rotor** for rotations, and\n",
    "- the **harmonic oscillator** for vibrations,\n",
    "\n",
    "combined with an electronic energy from a chosen quantum-chemical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab uses PySCF's `hessian.thermo` utilities to assemble these contributions and report thermodynamic quantities.\n",
    "As you work through the notebooks, keep the following connections in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how the normal modes and frequencies from a Hessian calculation enter the vibrational partition function, and\n",
    "- how the resulting thermodynamic functions relate to familiar relationships,\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\Delta_r G^\\circ = -RT\\ln K^\\circ,\n",
    "  \\qquad\n",
    "  G = H - TS.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- run a complete PySCF thermochemistry workflow (geometry optimization → Hessian → RRHO thermochemistry),\n",
    "- interpret key outputs (including the structure and meaning of `thermo_info`),\n",
    "- compute reaction $\\Delta_r G^\\circ$ values and convert them to equilibrium constants,\n",
    "- explain (qualitatively) how solvation models such as PCM affect computed thermochemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Conventions used in this lab\n",
    "- Standard conditions: $T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $P = 1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$.\n",
    "- Level of theory (used consistently across notebooks): PBE0-D4/def2-TZVPPD.\n",
    "- A polarizable continuum model (PCM) for water is included where indicated.\n",

    "## How to use this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Open and work through **Part 1**, **Part 2**, and **Part 3** **in order**. Each notebook builds on concepts\n",
    "and workflows introduced in the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Part 1](part1.ipynb)**  \n",
    "- **[Part 2](part2.ipynb)**  \n",
    "- **[Part 3](part3.ipynb)**  \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip} If the links do not open\n",
    "Some environments do not resolve notebook links. In that case, open the notebooks manually in JupyterLab:\n",
    "1. In the left **File Browser**, locate `part1.ipynb`, `part2.ipynb`, and `part3.ipynb`.\n",
    "2. Double-click each file to open.\n",
