    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the PySCF workflow that underpins all thermochemical\n",
    "calculations in this lab. The primary goal of **Part 1** is to become fluent\n",
    "with the sequence of electronic-structure calculations required to connect a\n",
    "molecular geometry to thermodynamic quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Parts 2 and 3, which focus on specific chemical case studies, this\n",
    "notebook emphasizes *computational methodology*. You will learn how to use PySCF to\n",
    "\n",
    "- define a molecular system and level of theory,\n",
    "- perform a geometry optimization,\n",
    "- compute a Hessian and vibrational frequencies, and\n",
    "- assemble zero-point and thermal contributions to obtain thermodynamic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same workflow will be reused in later parts of the lab; the difference is\n",
    "that later notebooks focus more on chemical interpretation than on new PySCF\n",
    "mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Part 1, you should be able to run a complete PySCF thermochemistry\n",
    "calculation starting from a molecular geometry, and to interpret the reported\n",
    "thermodynamic quantities in terms of translational, rotational, vibrational,\n",
    "and electronic contributions.\n"
